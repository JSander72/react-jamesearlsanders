                I was raised in Birmingham, Alabama and attended Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama with a major in Criminal Justice. I also became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity in Spring 2005. Throughout my life, I have faced challenges and overcome them through determination and hard work. That same grit will lead to my future success as a Software Engineer. I am excited to continue growing and educating myself in the field.
